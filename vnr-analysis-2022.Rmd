# Preamble

Initiate script

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # clear workspace
options(scipen = 999) # disable scientific notation
tmst <- paste("", format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")) # get current timestamp
font_fam <- names(pdfFonts())[10] # set font family
```

Load packages

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
```

Read data with results

```{r}
z <- readRDS(file = "vnr-results-2022.rds")
head(z)
```

## Analysis

The id's of the participants are:

```{r}
range(z$ID)
```

However, there are gaps

```{r}
ggplot(z, aes(x = ID)) +
         geom_histogram(color="black", fill="gray", binwidth = 500) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of ID's")
```

It seems that the ID's were given according to the registration into four level groups. The groups can be separated as follows:

```{r}
set.seed(2001)
groups <- kmeans(z$ID, centers = 4, iter.max = 20, algorithm = "Lloyd")
```

```{r}
groups$size
```

Create a group variable

```{r}
z$group <- factor(groups$cluster)
```

The ID's per group are:

```{r}
groups <- z %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(min_group = min(ID), max_group = max(ID)) %>% 
  mutate(range_group = max_group - min_group)
groups
```

So there were expected no more than 5,000 participants in groups 1, 2, 3 (probably also 4), so a maximum of 20,000 in total.

The times recorded were:

```{r}
summary(z$time_in_mins)
```

```{r}
z %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_in_mins)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), color="black", fill="gray", binwidth = 2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of times", x = "Time (minutes)", y = "")
```

Denote whether there was a company affiliation or not:

```{r}
z$company_bin <- ifelse(z$company == "NA", FALSE, TRUE)
table(z$company_bin)
```

Is there a difference between the two groups?

```{r}
z %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = company_bin, y = time_in_mins)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Effect of company affiliation on time distribution", 
       x = "Company affiliation", y = "Time (minutes)")
```

```{r}
t.test(time_in_mins ~ company_bin, data = z)
```

```{r}
z %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_in_mins, fill = company_bin)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_fill_discrete("Company affiliation") +
  labs(title = "Effect of company affiliation on time distribution", 
       x = "Time (minutes)", y = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Participants with a company affiliation seem to run faster!

Gender is designated in almost all records:

```{r}
summary(as.factor(z$sex))
```

```{r}
zbin <- z[z$sex %in% c("m", "w"), ]
```

Is there a difference?

```{r}
z %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c("m", "w")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(sex), y = time_in_mins)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Effect of gender on time distribution", 
       x = "Sex (m: Male, w: Female)", y = "Time (minutes)")
```

```{r}
t.test(time_in_mins ~ sex, data = filter(z, sex %in% c("m", "w")))
```

```{r}
zbin %>% 
  filter(sex %in% c("m", "w")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_in_mins, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_fill_discrete("Sex", labels = c("Male","Female")) +
  labs(x = "Time (minutes)", y = "",
       title = "Time by sex")
```

Males run definitely faster!

```{r}
z %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(group), y = time_in_mins)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Time distribution by group", 
       x = "Group", y = "Time (minutes)")
```

```{r}
zbin %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_in_mins, fill = group)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_fill_discrete(
    "Group", 
    labels = c("< 25 min","25 - 28 min", "28 - 31 min", "> 31 min")
    ) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of time by registered group", 
       x = "Time (minutes)", y = "")
```

```{r}
z %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(min_time = min(time_in_mins),
            mean_time = mean(time_in_mins),
            quant = quantile(time_in_mins, probs = 0.95),
            max_time = max(time_in_mins))
```

```{r}
filter(z, group == 1) %>% 
  mutate(offset = time_in_mins - 25) %>% 
  filter(offset > 0) %>% 
  summarise(mean(offset), n())
```

```{r}
filter(z, group == 1) %>% 
  mutate(offset = time_in_mins - 28) %>% 
  filter(offset > 0) %>% 
  summarise(mean(offset), n())
```

```{r}
filter(z, group == 1) %>% 
  mutate(offset = time_in_mins - 31) %>% 
  filter(offset > 0) %>% 
  summarise(mean(offset), n())
```
